This is a simple app that steers the user to taking positive action for calmness and relaxation. 
The screen will display a happy and an angry face at random positions and its the user's job to click on the happy face for positive feedback and avoid the angry face.
Whenever the user clicks a happy face, it increases the happy count by 1. Same goes for angry face. If the user keeps on clicking the happy face, the user should feel calm and relaxed.
Positive reinforcement should make the user click on the happy face more than the angry face.
